For example: If you deposit equal $1000 of ETH and USDC, but ETH doubles while USDC stays stable, you end up with less value than if you had just held the tokens. IL is temporary if prices return to original ratio. Mitigation: Use stablecoin pairs (minimal IL) or accept IL as cost of earning fees. Always calculate potential IL before providing liquidity.",
