For beginners, low-risk farms with established protocols are recommended.",

Many are scams or rug pulls. Recommendations: 1) Only invest what you can afford to lose. 2) Never borrow to invest. 3) Diversify across proven protocols. 4) Research thoroughly before any investment. 5) Consider sticking to 5-10% allocation to experimental DeFi.",

    "response_text": "Impermanent Loss (IL) occurs when token prices in a liquidity pool diverge from when you deposited. For example: If you deposit equal $1000 of ETH and USDC, but ETH doubles while USDC stays stable, you end up with less value than if you had just held the tokens. IL is temporary if prices return to original ratio. Mitigation: Use stablecoin pairs (minimal IL) or accept IL as cost of earning fees. Always calculate potential IL before providing liquidity.",
